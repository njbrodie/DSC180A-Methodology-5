**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**\
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was how the places that produce the most emissions and that have had the largest overall impact on global warming, generally aren't going to see the harshest impacts. While the U.S. is one of the biggest producers of emissions, it isn't going to be as impacted by global warming as many other places. Additionally, I think it is really interesting how there is a portion of the Atlantic ocean that is actually predicted to get cooler, while practically the rest of the entire planet is heating up.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**\
One potential investigation I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 Project would be to look at other measurements that were not originally used in the model. For example, looking at sea-level rise or looking at different levels of CO2 emissions, which would enable me to see different possible pathways that the world could take.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**\
One change to the approach tken in my current Quarter 1 Project would be to meet up with my team more often because I think that this would help us work together a little bit better an get a better feel for each of our strengths and weaknesses.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**\
I would be interested in using some coding techniques to make the graphs more interactable. The majority of the graphs that we have looked at or have coded have been static, but I think making the graphs interactable would enable a reader to be more engaged with the data and be able to see each of the impacts on global warming in real time.
